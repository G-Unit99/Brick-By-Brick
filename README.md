As we all know, systematic racism is a travesty that has saddly affected several minority communities within the United States. 
    Issues range from redlining all the way to gentrification. 

As a result our project focused on the topic of urban development within the St. Louis area. Thus our team planned on implementing a

This system collected data from housing prices and other data, alongside crime rates within St. Louis and address any correlations between
  the two to and spread awareness of the need to assist in breaking down these barriers.
